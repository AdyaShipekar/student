    "I have improved so much, both as a coder and an innovator, since the beginning of this trimester. Through my learning about basic coding tools, fundamental topics in JavaScript, and ability to code both simple and more complex games (from Animated Background to our complicated 6-level mansion game), I have gathered so much knowledge to use in future coding endeavors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond academics, I have had so much fun in my CSSE group. Coding with my group and bringing games and characters to life using classroom ideation was a truly unique experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "Being scrum master of my group helped me gain critical leadership skills and opportunities. Managing the class and overseeing the Quest of Spook also improved my ability to collaborate with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of the year (near the end of Sprint 1), we graded ourselves using a checklist/rubric. Although I gave myself a pretty high score, I now realize how limited my knowledge of the vast realm of coding was. I have the rubric below, with self-graded scores on where I think I was at the start of the trimester compared to where I am now (both in my coding abilities and my ability to lead my group and my class).\n",
